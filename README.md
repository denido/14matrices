# 14 matrices

Code to calculate transport properties of 1D-quantum system connected to two periodic electrodes.

**How to use**: 

1.  main.py, class_fourteen_matrices.py, config.yml, mo.py have to be in the root-dir.

2.  the root-dir has to contain a dir called: Input/<your_system> which contains the 14 matrices for the system of interest as numpy arrays stored in *.dat files.

3.  The code will create a directory called Output/<your_system> which will contain dos.dat, trans.dat and a Plot/ with the corresponding *.png files.
