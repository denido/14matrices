# 14 matrices

Code to calculate transport properties of 1D-quantum system connected to two periodic electrodes.

How to use: a) main.py, class_fourteen_matrices.py, config.yml, mo.py have to be in the root-dir
	   b) the root-dir has to contain a dir called: Input/<your_system> which contains the 14 matrices for the system of interest as numpy arrays stored in *.dat files.
	   c) The code will create a directory called Output/<your_system> which will contain dos.dat, trans.dat and a Plot/ with the corresponding *.png files.
